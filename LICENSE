Source corpora

All texts are adapted from the ReM, ReF, and DTA corpora under Creative Commons attribution and share-alike licenses (CC BY-AT 4.0). Our corpus uses the word forms of the source texts, and in some cases also their lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging. The syntactic parsing is our own.

You are free to use the texts for any scientific or commercial purposes as long as you attribute to the Indiana Parsed Corpus of Historical (High) German and link to this website.
