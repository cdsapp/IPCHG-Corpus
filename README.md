# IPCHG-Corpus
Here are the latest versions of the parsed texts of the Indiana Parsed Corpus of Historical (High) German, or IPCHG. The texts are divided between: 
- MHG (Middle High German; 1050-1350)
- ENHG (Early New High German; 1350-1650)
- NHG (Modern/New High German; 1650-1950).

Once downloaded, they can be queried using CorpusSearch2. For a simplified query interface (but with slightly older versions of the texts), see https://ipchg.iu.edu/query/index.html

Full corpus documentation is at https://ipchg.iu.edu
